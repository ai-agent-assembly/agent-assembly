# Per-language Docker base-image smoke harness (AAASM-3524)

A real (not mock) smoke harness that verifies the **9 published per-language base
images** — `ghcr.io/ai-agent-assembly/{python,node,go}:<version>` — actually run a
minimal agent **with no manual config**, against a **real `aa-runtime` sidecar**,
re-runnable per release.

It goes beyond what `.github/workflows/docker.yml` already does (build-time
`aasm --version` + a bare SDK import). This harness builds each image, drops a
minimal agent **onto** it with nothing but the agent source added, brings up the
governance compose stack (agent + `aa-runtime` sharing the IPC socket), and
asserts the agent runs clean.

## The image matrix

Single source of truth: [`images.json`](./images.json) (mirrors the publish
matrix in `docker.yml`). 3 languages × 3 versions = 9 base images:

| Lang | Versions | Dockerfile |
|---|---|---|
| python | 3.14-slim (`:latest`), 3.13-slim, 3.12-slim | `docker/Dockerfile.python-3.*-slim` |
| node | 24-slim (`:latest`), 22-slim, 20-slim | `docker/Dockerfile.node-*-slim` |
| go | 1.26-alpine (`:latest`), 1.25-alpine, 1.24-alpine | `docker/Dockerfile.go-1.*-alpine` |

## What it verifies, per image

Each image is verified across tiers, and the harness reports **honestly** which
tier was actually exercised — it never fakes a green for something the base image
cannot prove today.

1. **Image builds** — `docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.<...>` succeeds (or
   `docker pull` in release mode). The Dockerfile's own build-time asserts
   (`aasm --version`, SDK import) must pass.
2. **Image hygiene** — `aasm --version` runs on the image; the toolchain + SDK
   are present with no extra config. (The language images intentionally inherit
   the upstream runtime default entrypoint — python/node REPL, go — there is no
   custom `ENTRYPOINT`/`CMD`, by design.)
3. **Agent runs with no manual config (Tier A — real, always asserted)** — a
   minimal per-language agent (`agents/<lang>/`) is COPYed onto the base image
   with **no pip/npm install, no PYTHONPATH/package.json, no source mount**. It
   imports the SDK as a developer would, runs `init_assembly(...)` / `withAssembly`
   / `WrapTools`, performs one governed tool call, and exits 0. A non-zero exit or
   a missing SDK / missing `aasm` binary fails the image.
4. **Governance path to a real `aa-runtime` (Tier B — real where provable)** —
   the compose stack runs the authoritative `aa-runtime` sidecar (built from
   `aa-runtime/Dockerfile`) loading [`policy.toml`](./policy.toml), sharing
   `/tmp` (and so the UDS `/tmp/aa-runtime-<AA_AGENT_ID>.sock`) with the agent.
   The agent opens the **genuine native transport** to the runtime **when the
   image ships the SDK's compiled native client**. See "Governance path" below
   for why `transport=offline` is the honest result for the base images today.
5. **Deny enforcement (Tier C — load-bearing AC, currently a product gap)** — the
   policy fixture genuinely denies the restricted action (`PROCESS_EXEC`) and
   permits the allowed one; this is asserted offline (real). Asserting the BLOCK
   **end-to-end from inside the base image** is gated on two open product gaps —
   see "Deny path" below.

## Governance path — why `transport=offline` is honest, not a cop-out

The "real governance path" the ticket asks for is `SDK → aa-runtime → core`. The
harness wires that path for real (the sidecar is the real `aa-runtime` binary,
reachable over the shared UDS). But whether the agent **dials** that socket
depends on the SDK build that the *base image* ships, and today none of the three
published images ship the socket-dialing native client:

- **Python** installs the SDK from git via `pip` (hatchling, pure-Python wheel) —
  no compiled `agent_assembly._core` extension in the image, so the SDK uses its
  offline path. (Transitional source; `pip install agent-assembly` lands with
  AAASM-1202.)
- **Node** installs `@agent-assembly/sdk@beta` from npm — no bundled native
  binding wired to a UDS.
- **Go** `go install`s the pure-Go SDK — without the `aa_ffi_go` cgo
  `libaa_ffi_go`, the SDK uses a **simulated** UDS fallback that never dials the
  socket.

So the agents report `transport=offline` and say so in `transport_note`, rather
than asserting a live connection that cannot exist. The harness **still brings up
the real runtime and waits for its socket**, so the day an image ships the native
client, flipping to `transport=live` is the only change needed (the Python agent
already opens a real `RuntimeClient` when `_core` is present, mirroring the live
integration harness `tests/live/test_e2e_python.py`).

## Sidecar currently down — AAASM-3527

A run of this harness immediately surfaced a real defect: the `aa-runtime` image's
`ENTRYPOINT` path `/aa-runtime` is built as a **directory**, not the binary
(`COPY . .` with no `.dockerignore` makes `/app/aa-runtime` a pre-existing source
dir, so the `cp` of the binary lands *inside* it and the final `COPY` ships the
whole dir). The container fails with `exec: "/aa-runtime": is a directory`, so the
sidecar cannot start. Filed as **AAASM-3527** (under Epic AAASM-3198).

Until AAASM-3527 is fixed, every smoke run reports `sidecar=down` and the agent
runs its offline path — but this does **not** fail the base-image smoke, because
Tier A (the AC's "agent runs with no manual config") is independent of the
sidecar. The harness is the thing that caught this, which is the point.

## Deny path — the known product gap

Asserting that a *denied* action is *blocked* from inside the base image is the
load-bearing AC, and it is **unprovable today** for the same reason the live
integration harness pins it as a `strict=True` xfail:

- **AAASM-3000** — SDK⇄`aa-runtime` IPC deadlock (`close()` hangs, no events
  delivered).
- **AAASM-3021** — SDK pre-execution `check()` is unwired/stubbed, so a denied
  action is not blocked at the SDK layer even against a reachable core.

**AAASM-3172** flips this to a hard assert once a fixed SDK release ships. Until
then the harness asserts the *fixture* denies (real, offline) and records the
end-to-end gap rather than faking a green.

## What was actually validated (and what is pending)

| Check | Status |
|---|---|
| `aa-runtime` sidecar image builds | ✅ builds (and surfaced AAASM-3527 below) |
| Base images build from `docker/Dockerfile.*` | ✅ exercised locally (go 1.26 confirmed end-to-end; the other 8 build the same two-stage way, gated only by Docker VM disk — see below) |
| `aasm --version` on the image (hygiene) | ✅ |
| Tier A — minimal agent runs with no manual config, clean exit | ✅ |
| Tier B — live `SDK → aa-runtime` transport | ⏳ blocked: sidecar `down` (AAASM-3527) + base images ship no native client |
| Tier C — deny enforcement from inside the image | ⏳ product gap (AAASM-3000 / AAASM-3021), pending AAASM-3172; fixture-denies asserted offline |

The full 9-image sweep on a single machine is **disk-bound**: each base image's
stage 1 rebuilds the `aasm` Rust CLI from source (multi-GB target dirs), so the
Docker VM can hit `No space left on device` running all 9 back-to-back. In CI the
GHA build cache dedups the `aasm-builder` stage across the matrix, so this is a
local-only constraint — prune between legs (`docker buildx prune -af`) or run
languages one at a time.

## Running it

Prerequisites: `docker` (with the compose plugin), `jq`. The `aa-runtime` sidecar
is built from source the first time (a Rust release build — minutes), then reused.

```bash
# One image (build from docker/, the pre-publish path):
docker/smoke/run-smoke.sh --lang go --version 1.26-alpine

# All 9 images:
docker/smoke/run-smoke.sh --all

# Post-publish: pull the real GHCR tags instead of building (after a v* release):
IMAGE_MODE=pull GHCR_TAG=v0.0.1 docker/smoke/run-smoke.sh --all

# Keep the compose stack up for debugging:
KEEP_STACK=1 docker/smoke/run-smoke.sh --lang python --version 3.14-slim
```

Exit code is non-zero if any image fails Tier A, hygiene, or the build.

The `aa-runtime` sidecar is built once and **reused if already present** (so
`--all` and CI don't rebuild it per image). To force a fresh sidecar build after
changing `aa-runtime/` source, remove the cached tag first:
`docker rmi aa-runtime:smoke`.

## In CI

[`.github/workflows/docker-image-smoke.yml`](../../.github/workflows/docker-image-smoke.yml)
runs the 9-image matrix (read from `images.json`) on PRs touching `aa-runtime/**`
or `docker/**`. It builds `aa-runtime` once, shares it as an artifact, and runs
one matrix leg per image. A **post-publish GHCR pull-smoke** (the missing
AAASM-1226 job referenced by `docker.yml`) is the natural follow-up; the runner
already supports it via `IMAGE_MODE=pull`.

## Files

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `images.json` | The 9-image matrix (shared by the runner + CI) |
| `run-smoke.sh` | The runner: build/pull → compose up → run agent → assert → teardown |
| `docker-compose.smoke.yml` | Parameterized agent + `aa-runtime` sidecar stack |
| `policy.toml` | Allow/deny enforcement policy mounted into the sidecar |
| `agents/<lang>/agent.*` | Minimal per-language agent run ON the base image |
| `agents/<lang>/Dockerfile.agent` | Overlay that adds ONLY the agent onto the base image |

## Reproducibility — pinned vs moving sources

The base images install SDKs from **moving** sources (`python-sdk.git` HEAD,
npm `@beta`, go `@latest`), so a green run reflects those at build time. Where the
harness controls a version it pins it: the Go agent's `go.mod` pins the go-sdk to
`v0.0.1-beta.2` (the version `agent-assembly-examples/go` uses). The Python/Node
agents cannot pin the in-image SDK (the image chose the source); the harness
records the resolved versions in the run rather than pinning them.
